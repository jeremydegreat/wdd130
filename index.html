        <p>
            My name is Jeremy Great, and I come from a family of four, where I am privileged to be the firstborn. I hold a diploma in Music from Nnamdi Azikiwe University (UNIZIK), which helped nurture my passion for creativity and the arts. Over the years, I have gained valuable experience working with several financial institutions, where I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

            Additionally, I have ventured into the world of forex and cryptocurrency trading, which has honed my expertise in market analysis, risk management, and investment strategies. This has given me a deep understanding of financial markets and the importance of adaptability in a constantly evolving economic landscape.

            Currently, I am advancing my professional journey by studying software development through an online program at Brigham Young University-Idaho (BYUI). This decision reflects my commitment to staying at the forefront of technological innovation and combining my diverse skill set to solve real-world problems effectively.
